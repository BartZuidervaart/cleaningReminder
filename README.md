# CleaningReminder

This project is made for a old tablet or phone.
It can be used to display as a clock, while also showing routinely schedules such as watering plants or cleaning the floor.
Every task can have its own cycle.
A list will show next to the clock, placing the task that is most due on top.
If a task is past a due date it will animate red, indicating that this needs to happen as soon as possible.
Turning a living room clock into a sort of scheduler as well.
Mostly done for fun.
